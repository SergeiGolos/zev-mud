# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a playable Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) using Ranvier as the server engine with a browser-based client interface. The goal is to create a small-scope, functional MUD that allows players to connect through web browsers instead of traditional telnet clients. The system will include basic gameplay mechanics like movement, inventory management, NPCs, combat, and account persistence, all accessible through a modern web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to connect to the MUD through a web browser, so that I can play without needing to install a telnet client.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player navigates to the web client URL THEN the system SHALL display a browser-based terminal interface
2. WHEN a player connects through the browser THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection to the game server
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL proxy all communication between the browser and the Ranvier telnet server
4. IF the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and attempt to reconnect

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to create and manage a character account, so that I can have persistent progress in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new player connects THEN the system SHALL prompt for character creation
2. WHEN a player provides character details THEN the system SHALL validate the input and create the character
3. WHEN a player disconnects and reconnects THEN the system SHALL restore their character state and location
4. WHEN character data is modified THEN the system SHALL persist changes to the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate through different rooms and areas, so that I can explore the game world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player enters a movement command (north, south, east, west, up, down) THEN the system SHALL move the character to the connected room if an exit exists
2. WHEN a player enters a room THEN the system SHALL display the room description, exits, items, and other players/NPCs present
3. WHEN a player uses the "look" command THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the current location
4. IF a player attempts to move in a direction with no exit THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with items in the game world, so that I can collect and use equipment and consumables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player uses the "take" command on an available item THEN the system SHALL add the item to their inventory
2. WHEN a player uses the "drop" command on an inventory item THEN the system SHALL place the item in the current room
3. WHEN a player uses the "examine" command on an item THEN the system SHALL display detailed information about the item
4. WHEN a player's inventory changes THEN the system SHALL update their persistent character data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to engage in combat with NPCs, so that I can experience challenging gameplay and earn rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player encounters a hostile NPC THEN the system SHALL initiate combat mode
2. WHEN a player uses an attack command THEN the system SHALL calculate damage and apply it to the target
3. WHEN a character's health reaches zero THEN the system SHALL handle death appropriately (respawn, penalties, etc.)
4. WHEN combat ends THEN the system SHALL return to normal gameplay mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with NPCs, so that I can receive quests, trade items, or gather information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player encounters an NPC THEN the system SHALL display the NPC in the room description
2. WHEN a player interacts with an NPC THEN the system SHALL execute the NPC's programmed behavior
3. WHEN an NPC has dialogue THEN the system SHALL display appropriate responses to player interactions
4. IF an NPC is hostile THEN the system SHALL initiate combat when appropriate conditions are met

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the game to be deployable in a containerized environment, so that it can be easily hosted and scaled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is packaged THEN it SHALL include Docker configurations for both the game server and WebSocket proxy
2. WHEN deployed using containers THEN the system SHALL maintain all functionality available in development
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically configure database connections and required services
4. WHEN system logs are generated THEN they SHALL be accessible for monitoring and debugging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN core game mechanics are implemented THEN they SHALL have corresponding unit tests
2. WHEN the WebSocket proxy is implemented THEN it SHALL have integration tests for telnet communication
3. WHEN player actions are performed THEN the system SHALL validate expected outcomes through automated tests
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL provide clear feedback on system functionality and any failures
