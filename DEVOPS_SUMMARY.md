- **Health Checks**: Automated service monitoring

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Container Security**: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- **Network Security**: Security groups and network policies
- **Secrets Management**: Kubernetes secrets integration
- **Access Controls**: RBAC and least privilege

### **Scalability & Performance**
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: CPU and memory-based scaling
- **Resource Limits**: Proper resource allocation per service
- **Load Testing**: Performance validation procedures
- **Connection Scaling**: WebSocket proxy configuration for high load
